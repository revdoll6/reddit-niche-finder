# Reddit Niche Finder Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines the step-by-step process for implementing the Reddit API integration and subreddit discovery features in the Reddit Niche Finder application.

## Phase 1: Reddit API Configuration

### 1. Reddit API Requirements

Based on the Reddit API documentation, we need the following credentials:

- **Client ID**: Obtained when registering your app on Reddit
- **Client Secret**: Provided when registering your app on Reddit
- **Reddit Username**: Your Reddit account username
- **Password**: Your Reddit account password (for some authentication methods)
- **User Agent**: A unique identifier for your app (e.g., "Reddit Niche Finder v1.0 by /u/yourusername")

### 2. Setting Up the API Configuration UI

1. Enhance the existing `Api.vue` component in the settings section to include all required fields:
   - Client ID input
   - Client Secret input
   - Reddit Username input
   - User Agent input (with a default value)
   - Test Connection button

### 3. Backend API Configuration Storage

1. Create a migration for storing API credentials securely
2. Create an API Controller for managing credentials
3. Implement encryption for sensitive data (Client Secret)
4. Create routes for saving and retrieving API configuration

### 4. Testing API Connection

1. Implement a test endpoint that verifies the provided credentials
2. Create a service class for Reddit API interactions
3. Add visual feedback in the UI for successful/failed connections

## Phase 2: Reddit API Integration Services

### 1. Core API Service

1. Create a `RedditApiService` class that handles:
   - Authentication (OAuth2)
   - Rate limiting
   - Request retries
   - Error handling

2. Implement basic API methods:
   - `getSubredditInfo(subredditName)`
   - `searchSubreddits(query, limit)`
   - `getSubredditPosts(subredditName, sort, limit)`

### 2. Data Models and Storage

1. Enhance the existing Subreddit model
2. Create caching mechanisms for API responses
3. Implement database storage for tracked subreddits

## Phase 3: Subreddit Discovery Implementation

### 1. Niche Explorer Feature

1. Enhance the `Explorer.vue` component:
   - Connect search input to the API
   - Implement loading states
   - Create result card components
   - Add pagination for results

2. Implement filtering and sorting:
   - By member count
   - By engagement rate
   - By creation date
   - By post frequency

### 2. Community Search Feature

1. Enhance the `Search.vue` component:
   - Connect advanced search form to the API
   - Implement category filtering
   - Add sorting options
   - Create detailed result views

### 3. Recommended Communities Feature

1. Enhance the `Recommended.vue` component:
   - Implement algorithm for finding related subreddits
   - Create interest tag system
   - Build recommendation engine based on user's tracked subreddits

## Phase 4: Data Collection and Analysis

### 1. Subreddit Analytics

1. Implement data collection jobs:
   - Subscriber count tracking
   - Post frequency analysis
   - Engagement rate calculation
   - Growth trend analysis

2. Create visualization components:
   - Growth charts
   - Engagement graphs
   - Activity heatmaps

### 2. Content Analysis

1. Implement post data collection
2. Create topic modeling algorithms
3. Build sentiment analysis integration

## Testing Plan

### 1. API Integration Tests

1. Test authentication flow
2. Verify rate limiting handling
3. Test error recovery
4. Validate data parsing

### 2. Feature Tests

1. Test search functionality with various queries
2. Verify filtering and sorting
3. Test recommendation algorithms
4. Validate analytics calculations

### 3. Performance Tests

1. Test API caching effectiveness
2. Measure response times
3. Optimize database queries
4. Test with large datasets

## Implementation Timeline

- **Week 1**: Reddit API Configuration (Phase 1)
- **Week 2**: Core API Services (Phase 2)
- **Week 3**: Niche Explorer and Community Search (Phase 3, parts 1-2)
- **Week 4**: Recommended Communities and initial Analytics (Phase 3, part 3 and Phase 4)
- **Week 5**: Testing, optimization, and bug fixes

## Getting Started

To begin implementation, follow these steps:

1. Register a Reddit app at https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
   - Click "create app" or "create another app" button at the bottom
   - Fill in the name, select "web app"
   - Set the redirect URI to `http://localhost:8000/auth/reddit/callback`
   - Note your Client ID and Client Secret

2. Update your `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   REDDIT_USERNAME=your_username
   REDDIT_USER_AGENT="Reddit Niche Finder v1.0 by /u/yourusername"
   ```

3. Begin implementing the API configuration UI in the settings section
4. Create the backend storage and service classes
5. Test the connection before proceeding to the discovery features
