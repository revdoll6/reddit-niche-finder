# Reddit API Implementation

This document summarizes the implementation of the Reddit API integration and subreddit discovery features in the Reddit Niche Finder application.

## Components Implemented

### Backend

1. **Database Migrations**
   - `api_credentials` table for storing Reddit API credentials
   - `api_keys` table for managing API keys
   - `api_rate_limits` table for configuring rate limiting

2. **Models**
   - `ApiCredential` model with encryption for sensitive data
   - `ApiKey` model with key generation functionality
   - `ApiRateLimit` model for managing API request limits
   - Updated `User` model with relationships to API models

3. **Services**
   - `RedditApiService` for handling Reddit API interactions
   - Authentication with OAuth2
   - Rate limiting and caching
   - Methods for subreddit discovery and information retrieval

4. **Controllers**
   - `ApiSettingsController` for managing API credentials and settings
   - `RedditController` for handling subreddit discovery and tracking

5. **Routes**
   - API routes for settings management
   - API routes for Reddit API interactions

### Frontend

1. **API Configuration UI**
   - Enhanced `Api.vue` component with reactive data
   - Form for entering Reddit API credentials
   - Test connection functionality
   - API key management
   - Rate limiting configuration

2. **Subreddit Discovery UI**
   - Enhanced `Explorer.vue` component with API integration
   - Search functionality with loading states
   - Results display with pagination
   - Sorting and filtering options
   - Subreddit tracking functionality

## Authentication Flow

1. User enters Reddit API credentials in the settings page
2. Credentials are securely stored in the database with encryption
3. When making API requests, the service:
   - Authenticates with Reddit using OAuth2
   - Caches the access token for future requests
   - Handles token expiration and renewal

## Subreddit Discovery Flow

1. User enters keywords in the Explorer component
2. Frontend makes a request to the backend API
3. Backend service authenticates with Reddit and makes the search request
4. Results are cached and returned to the frontend
5. Frontend displays the results with sorting and filtering options
6. User can track interesting subreddits for later analysis

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the API integration with real Reddit credentials
   - Verify rate limiting functionality
   - Test error handling and recovery

2. **Enhancements**
   - Implement more sophisticated categorization for subreddits
   - Add analytics for tracked subreddits
   - Implement scheduled data collection for tracked subreddits

3. **Additional Features**
   - Implement the Community Search component with advanced filtering
   - Implement the Recommended Communities component with personalized suggestions
   - Add data visualization for subreddit analytics
